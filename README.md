## Models and Model Fit
  - [x] linear regression 
  - [x] bsts, global trend
  - [x] bsts local trend
    
## Graphical Model Assessment
  - [x] plot with predictions against true values
  - [ ] priors vs posterior plots
  
## Analytical Model Assessment and Scoring Rules
  - [ ] Mean Squared Error MSE
  - [ ] Mean Absolute Error
  - [ ] others



### (Maybe future extensions)
  - autoregressive time model
  - semi-mechanistic model
  - maybe machine learning
  - maybe deep learning
