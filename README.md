# Epipredictr Workplan 

### Evaluate Predicions
Main Goal: Get a running framework to automatically score the predictions
made so I can compare different models against each other

### Implement different models
  - simple regression
  - autoregressive time model
  - semi-mechanistic model
  - maybe machine learning
  - maybe deep learning
