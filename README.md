# Epipredictr Workplan 

### Evaluate Predictions
Main Goal: Get a running framework to automatically score the predictions
made so I can compare different models against each other

##### implement the following probabilistic metrics: 
  - PIT (waiting for reply)
  - calibration YES
  - shaprness YES
  - bias YES
  - DSS YES
  - CRPS YES
  - Briar Score? 
  - Check for other scores
  
##### implement the following point prediction metrics: 
  - Mean Squared Error MSE
  - Mean Absolute Error

##### make a unified DataFrame with all the metrics

##### make graphs and plots to compare results

##### Do Documentation for the functions


### Implement different models
  - simple regression
  - autoregressive time model
  - semi-mechanistic model
  - maybe machine learning
  - maybe deep learning
